# TypingTest (Tkinter)

A minimalist 60‑second typing trainer built with Python’s Tkinter. When the program starts it immediately shows one of five random sentences (each ≥ 50 characters). Your first keystroke starts the countdown. Type the sentence exactly before the 60 seconds expire, or let the timer run out—either way, a dialog pops up displaying your time taken and whether the sentence matched perfectly, then the app closes.

Run: python main.py
